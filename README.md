# Basic tutorial on training a neural network using Tensorflow<2.0.0 and Pytorch from scratch

The data is prepared and stored as .h5 file. 

You can change the model structure under Net class.

Also both codes are comparing a similar model, therefore it can be used for a time comparison between Pytorch and Tensorflow for training network.

The codes also write a tensorboard file for visualization on tensorboard.
